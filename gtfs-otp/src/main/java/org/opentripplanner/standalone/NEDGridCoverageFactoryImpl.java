     * Summarizing from http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/csdl/learn_datum.html: Like GPS,
     * OpenStreetMap uses the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS84) coordinate system, and altitudes
     * in OSM are measured relative to the WGS84 datum. On the other hand, USGS elevation data from
     * the National Elevation Dataset (NED, http://ned.usgs.gov/) are referenced to the North
     * American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). The NAVD88 datum used by NED is an "orthometric"
     * datum based on mean sea level in one particular part of the world; the so-called 3D datums
     * used in GPS and OSM are ellipsoids intended to cover the whole Earth. Orthometric datums like
     * NAVD 88 are equipotential (gravitational) surfaces of the Earth (geoids [1]) which include
     * the effects of topography because the Earth's mass is irregularly distributed. Ellipsoid
     * datums like NAD83 are smooth geometric approximations of the earthâ€™s surface (ellipsoids)
     * without topography. Differences between the two are significant (up to 100 meters). Current
     * geoid models relate NAD83 ellipsoid heights to NAVD88 orthometric heights, i.e. the geoid for
     * the continental United States is calibrated against and defined relative to the GPS
     * ellipsoid. According to http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=561, "it is generally
     * assumed that WGS 84 (original) is identical to NAD 83 (1986)." According to
     * http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/csdl/learn_datum.html "there is a 2 meter difference
     * between two of the most frequently used 3-D datums, the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83)
     * and the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS 84)." In OTP we convert between these two systems
     * using one of these geoids defined relative to an ellipsoid. The rasters describing the datum
     * are not included in OTP by default because they double the size of the OTP distribution, but
     * are only needed by people loading elevations in North America. In OTP we perform the
     * conversion using a geoid defined relative to the NAD83 ellipsoid. This is backed up by an
     * NOAA publication at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc95-19408.pdf stating
     * they are for all practical purposes identical, especially when using handheld equipment. NAD
     * 83 and WGS 84 ellipsoid equivalence is also explained in a post at
     * http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=97337. The datum rasters must be
     * downloaded from the OTP website and placed in the NED cache directory.
